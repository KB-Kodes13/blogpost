Blog Platform RESTful API
This project is a simple blog platform RESTful API developed using Spring Boot. It allows users to perform CRUD operations on blog posts. The API supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts. Exception handling and data validation are also implemented.

Project Setup
To set up the project, follow the instructions below:

Start by creating a new Spring Boot project. You can use Spring Initializr to bootstrap your project.

Add the necessary dependencies for Spring Web, JPA, and any other dependencies you require. Refer to the project guide for more details.

Create the necessary packages in your project structure:

com.blogapi.blogpost.model for the model classes
com.blogapi.blogpost.repository for the repository interfaces
com.blogapi.blogpost.service for the service classes
com.blogapi.blogpost.controller for the controller classes
Implement the BlogPost model class in the com.blogapi.blogpost.model package. The class should have the following properties:

id (Long): the unique identifier for the blog post.
title (String): the title of the blog post.
content (String): the content of the blog post.
author (String): the author of the blog post.
Generate the getters and setters for these fields using your IDE's auto-generation feature.

Create the BlogPostRepository interface in the com.blogapi.blogpost.repository package. This interface should extend JpaRepository<BlogPost, Long>. This will provide the basic CRUD operations for the BlogPost entity.

Implement the BlogPostService class in the com.blogapi.blogpost.service package. This class should handle the business logic for CRUD operations on blog posts. Use the BlogPostRepository to perform these operations.

Create the BlogPostController class in the com.blogapi.blogpost.controller package. This class should handle HTTP requests and call the appropriate methods from the BlogPostService. Implement the following endpoints:

GET /posts: Return a list of all blog posts.
POST /posts: Create a new blog post. The request body should contain the title, content, and author.
GET /posts/{id}: Return the blog post with the specified ID.
PUT /posts/{id}: Update the blog post with the specified ID. The request body should contain the new title, content, and/or author.
DELETE /posts/{id}: Delete the blog post with the specified ID.

Running the Project
To run the project, follow these steps:

Make sure you have met all the prerequisites and have the necessary dependencies installed.

Clone the repository or download the project source code.

Open the project in your preferred IDE.

Build the project to resolve any dependencies and compile the source code.

Run the main class of the project, which is annotated with @SpringBootApplication. This will start the Spring Boot application.

Once the application is running, you can test the API endpoints using an API testing tool like Postman.

Testing the API
To test the API, follow these steps:

Open Postman or any API testing tool.

Set the base URL to http://localhost:8080 or the appropriate URL and port number for your environment.

Use the available endpoints to perform the desired operations. Refer to the API documentation or the project's code for the request and response formats for each endpoint.

Send requests to the endpoints using the appropriate HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT,
